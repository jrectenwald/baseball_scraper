how do we navigate through each year to get to each piece of data


“boxscore.xml
An XML document that contains the box score for the game.
players.txt
A file that lists each player on each team. This file is very useful for mapping player ID numbers to player names.
Inning files
A directory containing an XML file describing what happened in each inning.
PBP files
A directory containing information on how each batter fared, down to the location of each pitch thrown and each ball hit.”

Excerpt From: Joseph Adler. “Baseball Hacks.” page 395

“Master
This table contains biographical information about each player, including their full name, birth date, country of origin, and batting and throwing hands. Each player has a unique ID (called playerID) that is referenced from other tables in the database.
Batting
This table contains batting statistics for each player, on each team, during each season. Rows are uniquely identified by playerID, teamID, yearID, and stint.
Pitching
This table contains pitching statistics for each player, on each team, during each season. Rows are uniquely identified by playerID, teamID, yearID, and stint.
Teams
This table contains information on each team for each season, including aggregate batting statistics, pitching statistics, the team record, and post-season performance. Each line is uniquely referenced by yearID and teamID.”
